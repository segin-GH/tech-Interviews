## Process Technical Interview 

Hey,

Congratulations on making it to our technical interview!

We aim to structure our interview process to support your success, recognizing that candidates have unique ways of showcasing their strengths.
To accommodate this, we've designed three distinct paths for our technical interviews. Please review these options before your interview and let us know which path you prefer!

## Option 1: The Traditionalist

*tl;dr - the usual leetcode algorithm puzzles*

Lots of developers have trained up their skills on platforms like [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/),
and [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). If you're one of the devs on that grind, this might be the path for you!
We don't want you to stress out about the environment for the code puzzle/challenge, so we let you do a simple screen share and pick what you prefer üôÇ¬†If you have no preference,
we're happy to set up a quick CodeSandbox!
Answers can be working solutions or pseudo-code, whichever you prefer!

**Remember - our goal isn't to see how fast you write the right answer. We're trying to learn about how you work and communicate.**

### General Structure

- ~15 minutes of general tech + team experience questions
    - Example: "Let's talk about a time where you ran into a technical problem that was harder than you had planned for. When did you discover that issue? If working with a team,
    how did you communicate the things that changed with them?"
- ~30-45 minutes of code puzzle
    - Can be pseudo-coded or real code
- Remaining time for questions about company, role expectations, etc

## Option 2: The Pragmatist

*tl;dr - same as above but with a realistic code problem*

We're big fans of making interviews feel more like the work you'll be doing on the job. This path is focused on that üôÇ

These problems will vary in type and complexity based on the role and level you're interviewing for. If you're not sure what type of problem you'd get after reading through the examples below,
please reach out to your recruiter and they'll be happy to give you more clarity ahead of your interview!

### Example problems

Junior embedded firmware engineer: [A simple AT cmd parser](https://github.com/segin-GH/tech-Interviews/blob/main/at-parser.md)


### General Structure

- ~15 minutes of general tech + team experience questions
- ~30-45 minutes of role-related code challenge
- Remaining time for questions about company, role expectations, etc

## Option 3: The Realist

*tl;dr - Bring Your Own Repo, we shadow you*

This is our crazy radical option and we're super excited about it!
Have a side project you're really proud of? Old website that needs an update? Open source library with a feature you want to add? Let's pair!
If this option is exciting to you, **please pick a project and email your recruiter about it ahead of time!** Bonus points if it's open source! Just don't bring work from any current or former employer please üôè

### General Structure

- 5-10 minute intro to the project and why you picked it
- 10-15 minute overview of the codebase and discussion of what we'll be working on
- ~30 minutes of trying to add new feature/fixing bug/whatever we're doing
- Remaining time for questions about company, role expectations, etc

## Option *n:* The Specialist

*tl;dr - Bring Your Own Interview Plan*

We're always looking to expand and improve our interview process. If you have ideas for ways we can modify, combine, or create new interview paths,
please don't hesitate to let us know! If you'd like to build a custom interview path with us, **please hit up your recruiter at least a week before your interview so we have time to plan with you!**

# What Do I Do Now?

If you have a good idea of which path you want to do, **email your recruiter and let them know**. If you're not sure just yet, feel free to chat with us about which options you're thinking about and we're happy to work with you to find the best one.
Remember - **our goal is to help you do your best**. If there's anything else we can do, don't hesitate to tell us!!!
